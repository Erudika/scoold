/**
 * JavaBean to configure Velocity for web usage, via the "configLocation"
 * and/or "velocityProperties" and/or "resourceLoaderPath" bean properties.
 * The simplest way to use this class is to specify just a "resourceLoaderPath";
 * you do not need any further configuration then.
 * *
 * This bean must be included in the application context of any application
 * using Spring's {@link VelocityView} for web MVC. It exists purely to configure
 * Velocity; it is not meant to be referenced by application components (just
 * internally by VelocityView). This class implements {@link VelocityConfig}
 * in order to be found by VelocityView without depending on the bean name of
 * this configurer. Each DispatcherServlet may define its own VelocityConfigurer
 * if desired, potentially with different template loader paths.
 *
 * <p>Note that you can also refer to a pre-configured VelocityEngine
 * instance via the "velocityEngine" property.
 * This allows to share a VelocityEngine for web and email usage, for example.
 *
 * <p>This configurer registers the "spring.vm" Velocimacro library for web views
 * (contained in this package and thus in {@code spring.jar}), which makes
 * all of Spring's default Velocity macros available to the views.
 * This allows for using the Spring-provided macros such as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * #springBind("person.age")
 * age is ${status.value}</pre>
