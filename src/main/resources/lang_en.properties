about.scoold.3 = learning new stuff,
about.scoold.4 = sharing knowledge,
about.scoold.5 = gathering and organizing information,
about.scoold.6 = helping your mates and earning reputation points while doing it.
about.scoold.7 = Information is organized around questions. Questions can be specific or they can be in the form of a discussion on a certain topic. Below every question are the answers which are sorted by votes. The number of votes indicates the quality of both answers and questions. Almost every post can be voted up (+) or down (-).
about.questions.9 = You can, of course, always answer you own question if you know the answer to it. This way you are helping others and it will also earn you some reputation. You can ask as many questions as you want but keep in mind that duplicate questions might be voted down or even deleted.
about.questions.10 = Everything related to the website itself should be discussed in the 'Feedback' section. There you can post all your site-related questions, suggestions, general feedback or feature requests.
about.questions.11 = A question might be closed for various reasons \u2014 it has too many answers, it's a duplicate of another question or it's just inappropriate. Closing a question means that no new answers can be posted but that doesn't affect the editing functionality. A question is automatically marked for closing once it reaches -5 votes.
about.questions.12 = Everyone with the 'Teacher' badge can edit questions.
about.answers.1 = Answers can be posted to any question that hasn't been closed yet. The good answers are always at the top and one of them can be approved as the best by the author of the question.

You should avoid posting answers that are one or two words long. \u0422hese should be posted as comments instead (see Comments).
about.answers.2 = Everyone with the 'Freshman' badge can edit answers.
about.revisions.1 = Every time you edit a question or an answer, a new revision is created. Revisions keep track of all the changes in the text, title and tags of questions and answers. The first revision is the original. The next edit you make will create revision #1, followed by #2 and so on.

about.comments.1 = Comments can be posted on all questions and answers. Basically, anything that's too short for an answer should be a comment. Comments can also contain suggestions, corrections or criticism. Bad comments will be voted down and automatically hidden once they reach -5 votes.

about.voterep.1 = Voting is an integral part of Scoold. If you like something useful or interesting, vote it up. Questions that are clear and well-written should also be given +1.
